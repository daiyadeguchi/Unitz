# Unitz (Ongoing Project)
Students' and advisors' hub, so that there won't be another Matt D'Avella

# Description
This is a application where students can check their progress, for example units taken/left and classes needed to be taken in the future, and interact with their advisor about their educational goals.

Java/Spring Boot and React are used just because I am learning these technologies, and I am aware that I need better reasons. It is ongoing learning for me and advice for the next project would be appreciated!

# How to install
Project is not finished yet. Will be added when once it is looking decent enough.

# Technologies used
Java w/ Spring Boot
PostgreSQL
NGINX
React

# DBDiagram 
<h5>*will be updated</h5>
